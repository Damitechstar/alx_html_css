                <h2>What is an Article Tag?</h2>
                <p>The HTML Article element represents independent (w.r.t a web document, page, site or application) content, for example a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget.
                In other words, the article element represents a component of a page that consists of self-contained composition in a document, page or a site.</p>
